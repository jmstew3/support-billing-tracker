# Support Billing Tracker

A comprehensive business intelligence dashboard that processes iMessage conversation data to extract, categorize, and analyze support requests. The application transforms raw chat messages into structured business insights through an ETL pipeline and provides an interactive React dashboard for data visualization and management.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Using Docker with MySQL Backend (Recommended)

1. **Set up environment variables**:
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your preferred passwords
# (Default passwords are provided for local development)

# For Twenty CRM integration, add:
# VITE_TWENTY_API_URL=https://your-twenty.com/rest/supportTickets
# VITE_TWENTY_API_TOKEN=your-bearer-token
# VITE_TWENTY_USE_MOCK=false
```

2. **Start all services with Docker**:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Docker Compose automatically loads the `.env` file from the project root.

3. **Import existing data** (if you have CSV data):
```bash
./docker-import.sh data/03_final/requests_table.csv
```

4. **Access the dashboard**:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:3011/api
- MySQL: localhost:3307 (user: thaduser, password: from .env)

See [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md) for detailed Docker instructions.

### Manual Setup (Without Docker)

1. **Export messages from iMessage database**:
```bash
python3 export_imessages.py chat-backup.db 2251 2025-05-01 2025-09-15 data/01_raw/messages_export.csv
```

2. **Clean and preprocess messages**:
```bash
cd src
python3 data_preprocessor.py
```

3. **Extract business requests**:
```bash
cd request-extractor
python3 main.py
```

4. **Start the dashboard**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🔒 Security & Authentication

### Current Implementation: BasicAuth (Phase 1)

The application is protected by HTTP Basic Authentication at the Traefik reverse proxy level. When accessing the production URL, users will be prompted for credentials.

#### Default Credentials
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `PeakonBilling2025`
- **Production URL:** `https://velocity.peakonedigital.com/billing-overview`

#### Changing Authentication Credentials

To update the username and password:

1. **Generate new credentials hash**:
```bash
docker run --rm httpd:2.4-alpine htpasswd -nb typeanewusername typeanewpassword
```

This will output something like:
```
newusername:$apr1$xyz123$hashedpasswordhere
```

2. **Update `.env` file**:
```bash
# Edit the BASIC_AUTH_USERS variable
# IMPORTANT: Escape $ as $$ for docker-compose
BASIC_AUTH_USERS=newusername:$$apr1$$xyz123$$hashedpasswordhere
```

3. **Restart the application**:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. **Verify the change**:
- Access the production URL
- Browser should prompt for new credentials
- Enter the new username and password

#### Logging Out

To log out and test new credentials:
1. Click the **Log Out** button in the sidebar (red button below Theme toggle)
2. Frontend sends request to logout endpoint which returns 401
3. Browser clears cached credentials and prompts for re-authentication
4. Enter username and password to log back in

**How it works:**
- Backend provides `/api/auth/logout` endpoint that returns `401 Unauthorized`
- Logout endpoint is **not protected** by BasicAuth (accessed via higher-priority Traefik route)
- Browser receives 401 response and clears its credential cache
- Works reliably in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari

**Note:** Only works in production (velocity.peakonedigital.com). On localhost, BasicAuth is bypassed.

#### Security Notes
- ✅ Credentials are hashed using Apache APR1 (bcrypt variant)
- ✅ Works over HTTPS for secure transmission
- ✅ Protects both frontend and backend API
- ✅ Logout button available in sidebar for re-authentication
- ⚠️ Single shared credential for all users
- 📝 For per-user authentication, see `docs/authentication-plan.md` (Phase 2)

#### Local Development
Local access (localhost:5173, localhost:3011) bypasses authentication. Only production access via Traefik requires credentials.

## 👤 Client Portal

The client portal provides a separate, client-facing view for customers to view their support tickets and hosted sites.

### Setup

1. **Run the seed script** to create test client and user:
```bash
docker exec support-billing-tracker-mysql mysql -u thaduser -pthadpassword thad_chat < backend/db/migrations/009d_seed_test_client_users.sql
```

2. **Access the portal**:
```
URL: http://localhost:5173/portal/login
```

### Test Credentials
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Email | `john.smith@acmecorp.com` |
| Password | `testpass123` |
| Client | Acme Corp |

### Notes
- Client portal uses separate JWT authentication from the admin dashboard
- Clients can only view their own data (tickets, sites, projects)
- No billing/cost information is exposed to clients

## 🔄 FluentSupport Ticket Sync

The application automatically syncs support tickets from FluentSupport (WordPress plugin) into the database. This allows you to view both iMessage SMS requests and FluentSupport tickets in a unified dashboard.

### Quick Sync (One Command)

To sync tickets from the last 7 days:

```bash
# Update date filter (change date as needed)
sed -i 's/VITE_FLUENT_DATE_FILTER=.*/VITE_FLUENT_DATE_FILTER=2025-10-17/' .env

# Restart backend and trigger sync
docker-compose restart backend && sleep 3 && \
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3011/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@peakonedigital.com","password":"PeakonBilling2025"}' \
  | grep -o '"accessToken":"[^"]*' | cut -d'"' -f4) && \
curl -X POST http://localhost:3011/api/fluent/sync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"dateFilter":"2025-10-17"}'
```

**Replace `2025-10-17` with your desired start date in YYYY-MM-DD format**

### Step-by-Step Sync Process

#### 1. Update Date Filter

Edit `.env` and change the `VITE_FLUENT_DATE_FILTER` variable:

```bash
# Only sync tickets created after this date (YYYY-MM-DD)
VITE_FLUENT_DATE_FILTER=2025-10-17
```

#### 2. Restart Backend

Apply the new configuration:

```bash
docker-compose restart backend
sleep 3  # Wait for backend to start
```

#### 3. Authenticate

Get a JWT token for API access:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3011/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@peakonedigital.com","password":"PeakonBilling2025"}'
```

Copy the `accessToken` value from the response.

#### 4. Trigger Sync

Run the sync with your token:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3011/api/fluent/sync \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{"dateFilter":"2025-10-17"}'
```

#### 5. Verify Results

Check the sync status:

```bash
# View sync summary
curl -s http://localhost:3011/api/fluent/status | python3 -m json.tool

# Check database
docker exec support-billing-tracker-mysql mysql -u thaduser -pthadpassword support_billing_tracker \
  -e "SELECT COUNT(*) as total, MIN(date) as earliest, MAX(date) as latest FROM requests WHERE date >= '2025-10-17';"
```

### Sync Behavior

**Deduplication:**
- Each FluentSupport ticket has a unique `fluent_id`
- System automatically detects existing tickets by ID
- **New tickets** → Creates new database records
- **Existing tickets** → Updates records with latest data
- **Safe to re-run** → No duplicate tickets created

**What Gets Synced:**
- Ticket description and subject
- Priority level → Urgency mapping
- Product/website information
- Customer details and timestamps
- All FluentSupport metadata

**What's Preserved:**
- Dashboard edits (hours, categories)
- Status flags (active/deleted/ignored)
- Manual adjustments and notes

### Recommended Sync Schedule

- **Weekly Updates**: Sync from 7 days ago every week
- **After Gaps**: Sync from last known good date
- **Historical Import**: Sync from earliest desired date (e.g., 2025-01-01)

### Troubleshooting

**"Access token required" error:**
- JWT token is missing or invalid
- Solution: Login again to get fresh token

**"Token expired" error:**
- Tokens expire after 1 hour
- Solution: Re-authenticate to get new token

**Sync returns 0 tickets:**
- Date filter may be too recent
- Solution: Adjust date to go back further

**Backend not reachable:**
- Container may not be running
- Solution: `docker-compose ps` to check, `docker-compose restart backend` to fix

## 📂 Archive Folder Structure

The `archive/` directory contains historical scripts and tools that are no longer actively used but are preserved for reference. This helps keep the project root clean while maintaining access to potentially useful code and documentation.

### Archive Subdirectories

#### `/archive/migrations/`
**Purpose**: Completed one-time migration scripts that have already been executed

**Current Contents**:
- `migrate-invoice-status-data.py` - Migrated Twenty CRM invoice statuses (completed Sept 30, 2025)
- `update-invoice-status-enum.py` - Updated Twenty CRM field metadata (completed Sept 30, 2025)

**When to Archive Here**: Place migration scripts here after they've been successfully run in production and are no longer needed for regular operations.

#### `/archive/diagnostics/`
**Purpose**: Debugging and diagnostic tools used to investigate or fix issues

**Current Contents**:
- `test_truncation.py` - Diagnostic script that identified text truncation bug in CSV output

**When to Archive Here**: Move diagnostic scripts here after the issue has been resolved but the script might be useful for similar future debugging.

#### `/archive/legacy/`
**Purpose**: Obsolete or deprecated scripts that have been replaced by newer implementations

**Current Contents**: Currently empty (obsolete files were deleted rather than archived)

**When to Archive Here**: Place old versions of scripts here when they've been completely replaced by new implementations but you want to keep them for historical reference.

### Archive Usage Guidelines

1. **Before Archiving**: Ensure the script is truly no longer needed for active operations
2. **Documentation**: Add comments to archived scripts explaining why they were archived and when
3. **Recovery**: Scripts can be moved back to active directories if needed in the future
4. **Security**: Review archived scripts for hardcoded credentials before committing

## 📚 Instructions Folder

The `instructions/` directory contains all technical documentation and guides that were previously scattered throughout the project root. This centralized approach keeps the root directory clean while making documentation easy to find.

**Contents Include**:
- Technical setup guides (Docker, MySQL, migration)
- Integration documentation (Twenty CRM, FluentSupport, n8n)
- Development plans and progress tracking
- Architecture and refactoring documentation
- Mobile optimization and UI/UX guides
- Testing checklists and debugging instructions

### Database Persistence & CRUD Operations

#### Real-Time Data Persistence
All edits in the dashboard are **automatically saved to the MySQL database** in real-time:

1. **Inline Editing**: Click any Category or Urgency cell to edit
   - Changes are saved instantly to the database
   - No manual save button needed
   - Visual feedback confirms the update

2. **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple requests using checkboxes
   - Change category for all selected items
   - Update urgency levels in bulk
   - Mark requests as deleted (soft delete)

3. **Status Management**:
   - **Active**: Normal requests included in all calculations
   - **Deleted**: Excluded from metrics but recoverable
   - **Ignored**: Marked as non-billable or irrelevant

#### How CRUD Operations Work

**CREATE** - Add new requests:
```javascript
POST /api/requests
{
  "date": "2025-09-16",
  "time": "10:30:00",
  "category": "Support",
  "description": "Help with website",
  "urgency": "MEDIUM"
}
```

**READ** - Fetch requests with filtering:
```javascript
GET /api/requests?status=active&category=Support
```

**UPDATE** - Edit existing requests:
```javascript
PUT /api/requests/123
{
  "category": "Hosting",
  "urgency": "HIGH"
}
```

**DELETE** - Soft delete (change status):
```javascript
DELETE /api/requests/123  // Soft delete
DELETE /api/requests/123?permanent=true  // Permanent delete
```

#### Database Schema
The MySQL database stores all request data with:
- Auto-generated IDs
- Timestamps for creation and updates
- Calculated fields for estimated hours
- Indexes for fast querying
- Status field for soft deletes

## 🗄️ Data Management

### Accessing the Database

**Via TablePlus or Other GUI Client**:
```
Host: 127.0.0.1 or localhost
Port: 3307 (not 3306)
User: thaduser
Password: [from .env]
Database: support_billing_tracker
```

**Via MySQL Command Line**:
```bash
mysql -h localhost -P 3307 -u thaduser -p
# Enter password from .env
USE support_billing_tracker;
SELECT * FROM requests WHERE status = 'active' LIMIT 10;
```

**Via API Endpoints**:
- View all requests: http://localhost:3011/api/requests
- Get statistics: http://localhost:3011/api/statistics
- Export to CSV: http://localhost:3011/api/export-csv

### Data Import/Export

**Import CSV to Database**:
```bash
./docker-import.sh data/03_final/requests_table.csv
```

**Export Database to CSV**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3011/api/export-csv > export.csv
```

### Backup and Recovery

**Backup Database**:
```bash
docker exec support-billing-tracker-mysql mysqldump -u root -prootpassword support_billing_tracker > backup.sql
```

**Restore Database**:
```bash
docker exec -i support-billing-tracker-mysql mysql -u root -prootpassword support_billing_tracker < backup.sql
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issue: API Error 500 After Restart

**Problem**: After running `docker-compose down` and `docker-compose up`, you see:
- "Error Loading Data - API error: 500" on Dashboard
- "No projects available. Check your Twenty CRM connection" on Projects page

**Root Cause**: Two common issues:
1. **Backend Port Mismatch**: `backend/.env` file overrides Docker environment variables
2. **Vite Cache**: Frontend serves cached JavaScript with old API URLs

**Quick Fix**:
```bash
# 1. Remove conflicting backend .env file
mv backend/.env backend/.env.local.example

# 2. Clear Vite cache and rebuild
docker-compose down
rm -rf frontend/node_modules/.vite
docker-compose build --no-cache frontend
docker-compose up -d

# 3. Verify it's working
curl http://localhost:3011/api/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok","database":"connected"}
```

**Why This Happens**:
- Docker Compose passes `PORT=3011` from `.env.docker`
- BUT `backend/.env` has `PORT=3001`, which overwrites the Docker value
- Backend starts on port 3001, but Docker mapped port 3011 → Connection fails
- Vite caches compiled environment variables, serving stale API URLs after restart

**Prevention**:
- ✅ Use `.env` as single source of truth
- ✅ Delete `backend/.env` to avoid conflicts (Docker provides all env vars)
- ✅ Always clear Vite cache when making environment changes
- ✅ Always use: `docker-compose up -d`

**Verification After Restart**:
```bash
# Check backend is on correct port
docker exec support-billing-tracker-backend printenv | grep PORT
# Expected: PORT=3011

# Check frontend has correct API URL
docker exec support-billing-tracker-frontend printenv | grep VITE_API_URL
# Expected: VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3011/api

# Test API health
curl http://localhost:3011/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","database":"connected"}
```

For detailed troubleshooting, see the "API Error 500 & Environment Variable Conflicts" section in [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md#api-error-500--environment-variable-conflicts-october-2025).
