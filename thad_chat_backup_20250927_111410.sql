The key in all of this is timing and stopping the bleeding. Right now we have I think 38 out of 64 websites live. Now I know a number of them are waiting on me for DNS. The challenge is in the 6 years of doing this, I was not always as organized as I am now and the remaining Ready sites require me to call each and every customer then work through finding or regaining DNS access. In addition to that, I just got extorted by Bren last week for $15k and waiting on my lawyer to get him to release the rest of my assets with no guarantee he won’t hit me with more surprise invoices. Then this week I’m about to pay another $10k to rebuild my entire CRM integrated architecture. Lastly, I’m still having to pay Bren every day these last sites are still being hosted by him. The miscommunication yesterday was your invoice was genuinely confusing to me. The other factor I’m weighing is I need your efforts focused on finishing these last 26 site migrations more than building another website. It’s not a price thing, it’s a stopping the bleeding of paying for 2 services and trying not to give Bren an extra penny if I can help it. I know your goals and they’re aligned with mine. I have no intereste in anyone else building websites for me as long as we can find the sweet spot of speed of execution without affecting the production line of projects I can keep flowing in. Once I’m done paying for double of everything, there will be more work all around. Until that point, I’m currently on the verge of tapping into my savings account to make it through this mess, which I am trying not to do if I can help it.','PROMOTION','Large','active','sms','2025-09-16 18:29:38','2025-09-23 20:27:20',0.00),(190,'2025-06-23','10:15:32','General Request','Email','I just set the hosting email as the Admin to the Capital Autobahnd website, can you accept that whenever you get a chance?','PROMOTION','Medium','active','sms','2025-09-16 18:29:38','2025-09-22 21:50:56',0.25),(191,'2025-06-23','10:17:51','General Request','Non-billable','?

The key in all of this is timing and stopping the bleeding. Right now we have I think 38 out of 64 websites live. Now I know a number of them are waiting on me for DNS. The challenge is in the 6 years of doing this, I was not always as organized as I am now and the remaining Ready sites require me to call each and every customer then work through finding or regaining DNS access. In addition to that, I just got extorted by Bren last week for $15k and waiting on my lawyer to get him to release the rest of my assets with no guarantee he won’t hit me with more surprise invoices. Then this week I’m about to pay another $10k to rebuild my entire CRM integrated architecture. Lastly, I’m still having to pay Bren every day these last sites are still being hosted by him. The miscommunication yesterday was your invoice was genuinely confusing to me. The other factor I’m weighing is I need your efforts focused on finishing these last 26 site migrations more than building another website. It’s not a price thing, it’s a stopping the bleeding of paying for 2 services and trying not to give Bren an extra penny if I can help it. I know your goals and they’re aligned with mine. I have no intereste in anyone else building websites for me as long as we can find the sweet spot of speed of execution without affecting the production line of projects I can keep flowing in.
