So we’re going to use Duplicator Pro instead.

So I’ll save those recommendations for after we complete the migrations. Since you’re now in charge of your own VPS, it’s important that you have some good firewalls set up inside your server to try and thwart any PHP injection attacks. Plugins offer Wordpress level security, which sometimes is enough. But if something slips through the cracks and infects your server, we’re talking big time eradication efforts and possibly even money to resolve. Not to mention client sites being down and you being on the hook for downtime. Even if the attack wasn’t necessarily your fault. I’ve been there done that. Not fun. And you might think “that’s why I’ll carry backups” but trying to pin point which website was the problem child (the source of the outbreak) and then which backup version is the “clean” one is like trying to untangle a bad knot.iINSDictionary",iMessage

Or 2. I can hit this button on the hosting upgrade, which will be an additional $347.12 for the remainder of the year. And $1,175.88 at renewal next year.

I went operation Fort Knox on your server and decided it’s best to put each website in it’s on cPanel environment to create isolation. I’m not confident in the current plugin-stacks / security protocols implemented inside of the current live sites, and I want to reduce the risk of something coming over and jumping out and infecting your other clients. I don’t think it’s a major / immediate issue, and we probably could have gotten by with the approach I was prepared to take. But it would have been kicking the can down the road and it’s better to take the comprehensive approach now during cut over than to have to do another mini-cutover later (where I would go from everyone in the same room to now everyone has their own rooms on your server).iIyNSDictionary",iMessage

I’m not stepping into what Bren was doing—and that’s not a knock on him—it’s just a different dynamic. And it’s the best thing for everyone. I’m running my own shop but bringing real capability to the table. If we frame this the right way, I think it actually makes you look even stronger: like you’ve moved on from that old setup and are building with legit partners who’ve got depth. You’re Nick Saban. Coaches leave you to go coach their own teams, players leave you to go pro. Hell, guys come over from being Head Coaches to win titles with you, and then they go win them by themselves again. But you reload every time. So I wouldn’t shy away from it framing it that way.iIwNSDictionary",iMessage

Right now we have I think 38 out of 64 websites live. Now I know a number of them are waiting on me for DNS. The challenge is in the 6 years of doing this, I was not always as organized as I am now and the remaining Ready sites require me to call each and every customer then work through finding or regaining DNS access. 

In addition to that, I just got extorted by Bren last week for $15k and waiting on my lawyer to get him to release the rest of my assets with no guarantee he won’t hit me with more surprise invoices. Then this week I’m about to pay another $10k to rebuild my entire CRM integrated architecture. Lastly, I’m still having to pay Bren every day these last sites are still being hosted by him. 

The miscommunication yesterday was your invoice was genuinely confusing to me. The other factor I’m weighing is I need your efforts focused on finishing these last 26 site migrations more than building another website. It’s not a price thing, it’s a stopping the bleeding of paying for 2 services and trying not to give Bren an extra penny if I can help it. 

I know your goals and they’re aligned with mine. I have no intereste in anyone else building websites for me as long as we can find the sweet spot of speed of execution without affecting the production line of projects I can keep flowing in. Once I’m done paying for double of everything, there will be more work all around. Until that point, I’m currently on the verge of tapping into my savings account to make it through this mess, which I am trying not to do if I can help it.iI)NSDictionary",iMessage

Texts trade convenience for quality and consistency and frankly, scalability.

I think I can provide the most value as a full-end-to-end managed service provider. And that may be what makes this fruitful for both of us from a time and investment perspective.

Not sure I want to go as far as to hand my biz phone number out to clients or engage in direct communication of any type (text, call, or direct email), but totally ok with slow rolling out a ticket system — first to you, get your feedback, then to maybe Brittany and a select number of clients who you have the best relationship with. 

Then we roll it out with intention and eventually monitor and handle a majority those requests as a white labeled service. I think that could be done for the right price. Not sure what that is yet but start thinking about how valuable that would be to you and we can get there when the time makes sense. You can get back out and just sell and handle the emergency. VIP and high leverage situations. And edge cases.

But where most of everything is sifted and sorted and handled without you needing to have your hands on it all but from a higher level, unless you wanted to.

Again, we’d need to slow walk that because (unlike with you and I where we can work with more agility and adjust things to one another’s preferences), with clients, expectations and boundaries / limits must be sharp from the start.

I couldn’t get to that setting because the backend of the plugin wasn’t loading properly in Wordpress Admin.

Leads were being recorded, and the client should still have been receiving email notifications from those lead submissions. But the form submitter (the user) was getting that 404 page despite successful form submission.

In other words, the entire form flow was working (SMTP and all), but the user was seeing a 404 page despite successful form submission. And I couldn’t fix the submission page issue without accessing the settings inside the backend of the plugin.

But now it’s all fixed.iIVNSDictionary",iMessage

The failure occurred because one of the attached images was unusually large, nearly twice the maximum size allowed by AWS (10 MB). Just FYI — we use AWS as our premium SMTP service for sender reputation, reliability, deliverability. They’re the gold standard in the industry, but with the reliability comes tighter restrictions on things such as attachment size.iI",iMessage

We’ve updated the behavior so that uploaded files are now included as secure download links instead. Recipients will still receive all the necessary information, but instead of embedded images / attachments, they’ll click the provided links to view or download the uploaded files. This change prevents future delivery issues while maintaining access to submitted documents. And it’s more secure because you can control access to links. You can’t control access to images once they hit someone’s email server.iINSDictionary",iMessage

If there was a specific reason they preferred having the raw images embedded directly in the email — and that workflow is essential — we can explore setting them up with an alternative to AWS that supports larger payloads or direct file attachments without the same size restrictions. But unless it was absolutely mission critical, this is the most reliable, more secure and most cost efficient solution.iINSDictionary",iMessage

In doing some of our technical review of the site, the ae-ppf site was flagged for having outbound links that go to a staging site, particularly on the service area page: https://ae-ppf.com/service-areas/ (https://ae-ppf.com/service-areas/)

Currently, most (not all) of these links point to a domain that begins with https://auto-elegance.velocityhosting.tech/ (https://auto-elegance.velocityhosting.tech/)

This should be corrected ASAP since search engines will see that and flag them as 
incorrect links. Can you please reach out to your dev team to have that corrected?iI0NSDictionary",iMessage

All of these tags are firing on /sun-masters-dfw which could cause tracking contamination. Multiple Google Ads accounts are receiving signals from Sun Master’s brand’s landing page. So basically, you’re running multi-brand Google Ads campaigns on a site where every brand page is broadcasting data to multiple unrelated Google Ads accounts. So there is probably some wasted ad spend, leaking audience insights, etc. I strongly recommend you work with your Google Ads team to build a clean GTM container, isolate each brand’s tracking to its own page, and remove the old container entirely.
