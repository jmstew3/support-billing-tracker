Then that could get used up quicker than you think. So you won’t be able to host unlimited sites, technically. Your limiting factor is the size of your sites and how good you are at clamping off the storage allocating to each WordPress installation.",iMessage

2025-05-13 16:41:41,Me,What’s the collective “weight” of your 30+ sites. How many gigs? Would be good to know going in. But knowing you can scale up gives you some grace.

You pay based on fluctuations in traffic and workloads with cloud, so your costs are variable and somewhat unpredictable. And the performance isn’t as sharp as with VPS or with Dedicated.

2025-05-13 16:54:25,Me,Customer service for all of them is pretty comparable too. Though I’ve heard WP Engine has really good customer service. Bluehost’s customer support is decent. Nothing to shake your pom-poms over. I have several years of experience working with them. Hit or miss but gets the job done more often then not when I reach out to them.

I just need admin access of some sort and then you can turn me loose. A velocity email is fine. But you finding what app you set up the 2FA code in would be ideal as to not create a new Admin user. Doesn’t matter to me either way.

Was pretty intensive, given the default out-of-the-box configurations are completely out of wack from a security standpoint. There were already over 1,000 brute force server-login attempts logged. So we needed to get that addressed ASAP. That’s done. Once I did that, I realized that the plugin we were using wasn’t the best for migrating sites from SiteGround. So we’re going to use Duplicator Pro instead. Know you already created .zip’s using WP Migrate, but that’s why I was telling you I felt it was best you held off on doing backups until after I was able to test Phantom. Realize you wanted to get copies in-hand in case he tried any funny business, but hopefully he hasn’t done anything significant in the last 48 hours and you can go through and re-run the backups.

When you move an established site to a brand‑new staging domain, the speed tools see an empty cache and “cold” setup (no pre‑built files or CDN copies), so the first audit will score lower.

So I’ll save those recommendations for after we complete the migrations. Since you’re now in charge of your own VPS, it’s important that you have some good firewalls set up inside your server to try and thwart any PHP injection attacks. Plugins offer Wordpress level security, which sometimes is enough. But if something slips through the cracks and infects your server, we’re talking big time eradication efforts and possibly even money to resolve. Not to mention client sites being down and you being on the hook for downtime. Even if the attack wasn’t necessarily your fault. I’ve been there done that. Not fun.

2025-05-28 12:37:06,Me,"We can upgrade but honestly, you’ll eventually want to offload these backups to Amazon S3. Which isn’t that expensive. 

Backups should be stored separately from your live production files—this improves reliability and protects server space.

Right now, 30GB of your 100GB limit is being used for backups. Offloading those to S3 will free up that space immediately, reduce risk of system issues, and allow you to scale retention off-server without filling up your hosting environment.",iMessage
2025-05-28 12:39:37,Me,"If we offloaded backups to S3 then that would immediately open up 30GB. You’re talking under $5-10 a month for 30-50 GB of backup retention. That’s my estimation. 

Just being fully transparent I don’t think I will have time this week to help you configure S3.",iMessage

2025-05-28 12:42:53,Me,"Two options: 1. stay where you are. Offload backups to S3 for $5-$10 per month (estimate). Free up the 30GB on your VPS and we’ll live to see a few more months or more, is my guess. Depending upon the size of these remaining sites. 

Or 2. I can hit this button on the hosting upgrade, which will be an additional $347.12 for the remainder of the year. And $1,175.88 at renewal next year. So that would upgrade your VPS storage to 200 GB and boost your server’s performance from an NVMe 4 to an NVMe 8, which solves for the “now” and “future” and set up the AWS S3 storage for you later.",iMessage
2025-05-28 12:44:06,Me,"But you might be paying for more than you need if we don’t use all that additional space, especially if the remaining sites aren’t that big and we offload the backups to S3 anyway.

This ensures that the last three days are retained in the specified sequence. So, on Saturday, you’ll have Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. Similarly, on the following Monday, you’ll have Thursday, Friday, and Monday. Etc. Additionally, I’ve set up a monthly backup schedule to run on the first of each month, which will automatically overwrite the previous month’s backup. I implemented this approach to preserve server space since backups count against your cap. As we discussed yesterday, I’ll be able to assist you in offloading these backups to a separate environment at a later date which will free up space on the VPS and also create a little more isolation in the event something unlikely happens on the VPS and you have to do a full restore.",iMessage

I went operation Fort Knox on your server and decided it’s best to put each website in it’s on cPanel environment to create isolation. I’m not confident in the current plugin-stacks / security protocols implemented inside of the current live sites, and I want to reduce the risk of something coming over and jumping out and infecting your other clients. I don’t think it’s a major / immediate issue, and we probably could have gotten by with the approach I was prepared to take. But it would have been kicking the can down the road and it’s better to take the comprehensive approach now during cut over than to have to do another mini-cutover later (where I would go from everyone in the same room to now everyone has their own rooms on your server).",iMessage

You’ve got real talent around you, and by tapping into what I bring, you’re leveraging an agency that’s a powerhouse in its own right. That’s a different league than what Bren was offering. He was more of an order-taker—you’ve got a real strategic partner now. Honestly, I think you frame this as a level-up. That old setup had you boxed in by the dynamic between Bren and Mike.",iMessage

You have an eye for opportunities for talent, a strategic vision and you are pretty technically sound for someone who has to split his time between running your biz and also working “for” your clients. We both share similar skills but you’ve really established and fostered relationships over the year, whereas I used to do that but I took a step back to become more technical.

So this isn’t anything you need to apologize over. Which I know you’re not but I’m just backing you up here. This is the best thing to happen to you and your clients. With that being said… Light intros as a strategic partner make total sense . I just want to be intentional about how I show up and what that signals. I’m not stepping into what Bren was doing—and that’s not a knock on him—it’s just a different dynamic. And it’s the best thing for everyone. I’m running my own shop but bringing real capability to the table. If we frame this the right way, I think it actually makes you look even stronger: like you’ve moved on from that old setup and are building with legit partners who’ve got depth. You’re Nick Saban. Coaches leave you to go coach their own teams, players leave you to go pro. Hell, guys come over from being Head Coaches to win titles with you, and then they go win them by themselves again. But you reload every time. So I wouldn’t shy away from it framing it that way.",iMessage

I would normally charge way more but I can rebuild it for $1,500 from scratch. We may need to do it in phases. Scrape the site and store the data, but then throw up a landing page experience that at least captures leads. And then we meticulously roll out updates for missing pages. To avoid long term SEO penalties, we will 404 redirect the pages that we don’t have time to rebuild immediately. That way we can completely hijack all control from him.",iMessage

2025-06-21 16:16:21,Me,"I don’t think we’re aligned. I was saying I can do $1,887.50 for duplicating the existing site and moving in the Locations page template logic + the first set of locations pages. Which is still a discount for me, honestly.

I can’t compete with $950 for a full site build, even if it’s “just” a copy and paste — I’m billing you for single one off landing pages at $500 a month so the pricing would be way out of wack there.",iMessage
2025-06-21 16:21:07,Me,"Just some inside baseball on my side, but I charge $500 for landing pages + a $100 monthly fee per lander for clients that I’m running PPC campaigns for, and I’m getting a 20% to 30% management fee for those. And that’s an average. Some I’m charging more for per month and less up front. Or I’m increasing my management fee in exchange for a “free” landing page. There are several ways to do it. But they all are offset with recurring monthly revenue from the management fees.",iMessage
2025-06-21 16:26:39,Me,"So $950 for a one-off website — if I’m being honest even a $2,000 one off — doesn’t do much to move the needle. Not without some level of consistent, recurring revenue behind it. Only going in-depth to help us find some longer term alignment.

2025-06-22 20:26:23,Thad Norman,"I didn’t get a chance to fully read this yesterday. The key in all of this is timing and stopping the bleeding. Right now we have I think 38 out of 64 websites live. Now I know a number of them are waiting on me for DNS. The challenge is in the 6 years of doing this, I was not always as organized as I am now and the remaining Ready sites require me to call each and every customer then work through finding or regaining DNS access. 

In addition to that, I just got extorted by Bren last week for $15k and waiting on my lawyer to get him to release the rest of my assets with no guarantee he won’t hit me with more surprise invoices. Then this week I’m about to pay another $10k to rebuild my entire CRM integrated architecture. Lastly, I’m still having to pay Bren every day these last sites are still being hosted by him. 

The miscommunication yesterday was your invoice was genuinely confusing to me. The other factor I’m weighing is I need your efforts focused on finishing these last 26 site migrations more than building another website. It’s not a price thing, it’s a stopping the bleeding of paying for 2 services and trying not to give Bren an extra penny if I can help it. 

I know your goals and they’re aligned with mine. I have no intereste in anyone else building websites for me as long as we can find the sweet spot of speed of execution without affecting the production line of projects I can keep flowing in. Once I’m done paying for double of everything, there will be more work all around. Until that point, I’m currently on the verge of tapping into my savings account to make it through this mess, which I am trying not to do if I can help it.",iMessage

It will all work out great, as we both have acknowledged. We just have to get through this rough patch, and we are. Website migration is absolutely #1 priority for you and me in this engagement, and we’ll keep chipping away at it. I think the two sites that are pending right now are pending SMTP config on Christian’s side. I’ll check with him this morning to see where we are with that. Should have those launched today.When it comes to the rapid fire quotes and pricing, it is what it is right now, we will just keep working through it.

Let’s continue to be as transparent as possible with one another on client budget, scope of work, etc. Feedback is huge. The faster we refine pricing, process, expectations, the quicker we start flying rather than gliding.Just know, I’m committed to helping get you back on your feet so long as I’m not knocked off of mine in the process. I’m no help if I’m destabilized on my side of the deal. Of course you know I have clients and priorities that existed prior to the emergency sirens that went off for you on the Velocity side. But I heard the sirens and ran toward it so, you should know I’m here for the battle. I see this as an investment in the future for both of us, so long as we can make our ends meet on the way there. So we are on the same page, I think.Looking ahead — I’m actively working on a few process and procedure things on my end, tailored to your business’ needs, to make updates, quoting and progress tracking easier for my side, as well as yours. Namely a ticket system. That way, we can get out of texts and try to get into a rhythm. Should have those done this week. Opened up my playbook from TP so this experience will be invaluable if you trust me on it, and give me feedback that makes it work best for your process as well. More to come there soon.Lastly, I know texts are convenient, but the nature of them makes it a very frictional process. I have to extract from the text and structure the request in a way that can be audited (for billing), delegated (for Christian to assist) and of course digested (when you ask about something or something else comes up, being able to follow a paper trail or breadcrumb to more quickly solve the lager issue at hand). Texts trade convenience for quality and consistency and frankly, scalability. What I learned with TurnPoint, somehow managing 40+ brands and 10 points of contact with just one other employee, was that tradability and workflow is critical. They paid me a lot to do that, as you can imagine. I essentially built their entire dev ops playbook that they took and brought in house when they cut my legs out from under me. But they’re still using the processes I implemented as a contractor, and they’re thriving because of it. A leak in the dam becomes a breach for all, and then the client is the ultimate loser in that scenario. Not to mention the risk it puts each of our businesses in. Audibility is huge for this as well try to make sense of just how much work and time is going into everything.

I think I can provide the most value as a full-end-to-end managed service provider. And that may be what makes this fruitful for both of us from a time and investment perspective.

Not sure I want to go as far as to hand my biz phone number out to clients or engage in direct communication of any type (text, call, or direct email), but totally ok with slow rolling out a ticket system — first to you, get your feedback, then to maybe Brittany and a select number of clients who you have the best relationship with. 

Then we roll it out with intention and eventually monitor and handle a majority those requests as a white labeled service. I think that could be done for the right price. Not sure what that is yet but start thinking about how valuable that would be to you and we can get there when the time makes sense. You can get back out and just sell and handle the emergency. VIP and high leverage situations. And edge cases.

But where most of everything is sifted and sorted and handled without you needing to have your hands on it all but from a higher level, unless you wanted to.

Again, we’d need to slow walk that because (unlike with you and I where we can work with more agility and adjust things to one another’s preferences), with clients, expectations and boundaries / limits must be sharp from the start.

Leads were being recorded, and the client should still have been receiving email notifications from those lead submissions. But the form submitter (the user) was getting that 404 page despite successful form submission.

In other words, the entire form flow was working (SMTP and all), but the user was seeing a 404 page despite successful form submission. And I couldn’t fix the submission page issue without accessing the settings inside the backend of the plugin.

2025-07-01 10:13:22,Me,"Appears as if they’ve been using this form since 2021. Previously, uploaded files were attached directly to the notification emails. We’ve updated the behavior so that uploaded files are now included as secure download links instead. Recipients will still receive all the necessary information, but instead of embedded images / attachments, they’ll click the provided links to view or download the uploaded files. This change prevents future delivery issues while maintaining access to submitted documents. And it’s more secure because you can control access to links. You can’t control access to images once they hit someone’s email server.",iMessage

If there was a specific reason they preferred having the raw images embedded directly in the email — and that workflow is essential — we can explore setting them up with an alternative to AWS that supports larger payloads or direct file attachments without the same size restrictions.

Currently, most (not all) of these links point to a domain that begins with https://auto-elegance.velocityhosting.tech/ (https://auto-elegance.velocityhosting.tech/)

So, this is a screenshot from tagassistant.google.com for the /sun-masters-dfw page — you can use this tool on your end and verify what I’m seeing. All of these tags are firing on /sun-masters-dfw which could cause tracking contamination. Multiple Google Ads accounts are receiving signals from Sun Master’s brand’s landing page. So basically, you’re running multi-brand Google Ads campaigns on a site where every brand page is broadcasting data to multiple unrelated Google Ads accounts. So there is probably some wasted ad spend, leaking audience insights, etc. I strongly recommend you work with your Google Ads team to build a clean GTM container, isolate each brand’s tracking to its own page, and remove the old container entirely. Only real way to ensure each brand’s campaigns are tracked correctly and independently",iMessage
